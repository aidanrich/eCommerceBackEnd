## Description
- We were tasked with creating a backend system for ecommerce.
- This isn't a full blown app, but with insomnia you can manage the database.


- This project helped us learn about MYSQL, Express.js, Sequelize and Insomnia.

## Installation
- You will need to use 'npm init' and 'npm i' in a command line while in the employee-manager folder.
- This will give you access to both mysql2, sequelize, dotenv and Express.js, which are needed to run this app.
## Usage
- In the terminal instance use the 'node server.js' command. This will spin up the server and allow you to query it through insomnia.
